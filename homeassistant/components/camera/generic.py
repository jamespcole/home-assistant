Support for IP Cameras.

This component provides basic support for IP camera models that do not have
a speicifc HA component.

As part of the basic support the following features will be provided:
-MJPEG video streaming
-Saving a snapshot
-Recording(JPEG frame capture)

NOTE: for the basic support to work you camera must support accessing a JPEG
snapshot via a URL and you will need to specify the "still_image_url" parameter
which should be the location of the JPEG snapshot relative to you specified
base_url.  For example "snapshot.cgi" or "image.jpg".
